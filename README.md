# NHL-Analytics

This project analyzes NHL team and player data from the past 10 hockey seasons (2010-2019). The data comes from Hockey Reference (https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams).

The goal of the project is to determine how the makeup of teams affects their regular season success. For example, I am aiming to discover the statistics that are important for the players at each level of the team (star players, middle line players, role players, etc). The response variable that I am using is regulation win percentage, in order to eliminate the randomness that NHL overtime introduces.
